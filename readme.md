# Download
```bash
npm i discordapilink
------ or ---------------------
yarn add discordapilink
```

# Setting Up
first of all, you would need to create a build process for sending and receiving data between your bot and its dashboard. **While using Api**

### Building the Server
```js
const { Build } = require('discordapilink');
const i = await new Build() // Start the build process by calling the build class and store it for later use
        i.setApis(["/api1","/api2"]); // you can add as many apis as you want 
        i.setWebsockets(["/ws"]) // you can add as many websockets as you want
        i.setEngine("express"); // Select a engine
        i.setPort(3000) // set a port where u wanna start the server
        i.build() // build the server **!Important** 
```
### Build Options
- `setApis` - set the apis for the server
- `setWebsockets` - set the websockets for the server 
- `setEngine` - set the engine for the server
- `setPort` - set the port for the server
- `build` - build the server
**!Important** - `build` should be called at the end of the build process

**Extra Options** - Should not be used while building the server
- `getApis` - get the apis currently loaded in the server 
- `getWebsockets` - get the websockets currently loaded in the server
- `getlength` - get the length of apis loaded 
- `getlogs` - get the logs of the server runtime Or Error 
- `clearlogs` - clear the logs of the server runtime Or Error

### Sending Data through Api
```js
const { Api } = require('discordapilink');
const a : Api = await new Api();
        const testData = {
            apiName : "api1",
            guild: message.guild?.name,
            channel: message.channel.id,
            user: message.author.id
        } // Example Data<Object>. can be anything
        
    a.setData({test: testData}) // set the data to be sent can be anything
    a.setMessage("This is a test message Check Status 200 OK") // set the message to be sent can be anything
    a.setStatus(200) // set the status code to be sent can be anything but sucess codes are recommended
    a.send("api1"); // send the data to the api
```
### Api Options
- `setData` - set the data to be sent
- `setMessage` - set the message to be sent
- `setStatus` - set the status code to be sent
- `send` - send the data to the api

### Receiving Data through Api
```js
const { Api } = require('discordapilink');
const a : Api = await new Api();
    a.receive("api1") // receive the data from the api where data was sent
```
### Sending Data through Websocket
```js
const { Websocket } = require('discordapilink');
const ws : Websocket = await new Websocket();
        const testData = {
            WebsocketName : "ws",
            guild: message.guild?.name,
            channel: message.channel.id,
            user: message.author.id
        } // Example Data<Object>. can be anything
        
    ws.setData({test: testData}) // set the data to be sent can be anything
    ws.send("/ws"); // send the data to the api or ws.send("ws")
```
### Websocket Options
- `setData` - set the data to be sent
- `send` - send the data to the websocket

### Infomative operations
```js
const { Build } = require('discordapilink');
/**
 * The Build class is used to build the server 
 * Important - Informative options should be used after the build process is completed
 */
//assuming that the build process is completed and is stored in a variable called i
i.getApis() // get the apis currently loaded in the server
i.getWebsockets() // get the websockets currently loaded in the server
i.getlength() // get the length of apis loaded
i.getlogs() // get the logs of the server runtime Or Error
i.clearlogs() // clear the logs of the server runtime Or Error
```
